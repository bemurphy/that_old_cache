That Old Cache
==============

Description
-----------

Getting sick of memcached just kicking your stuff out of memory in Rails? Maybe you've thought
*"Gee, wouldn't it be nice to just serve the old cache while I refresh it."* Well, look no
further! **That Old Cache** is a Rubygem that does just that, giving you the ability to fire
off a process to refresh the cache once it expires, without the annoying "initial load" problem
that affects your users.
